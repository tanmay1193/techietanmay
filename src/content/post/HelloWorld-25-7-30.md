## Hello from the other side
_Welcome to my first blog post on my first website on the internet._

It feels surreal saying that.

There're over [1.5 billion websites online](https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/), yet we found each other. Must be some good routing.

Hi again, I'm Tanmay (Techie) a Network analyst, cybersecurity learner and gamer who likes chai (coffee on fridays) more than big talk (I do enjoy small talk :p).

## Why this Blog?
I’ve always had ideas. Some I start. Few I finish. This blog is my way of changing that.
It’s a quiet place on the internet where I can think out loud, share what I’m learning, and maybe help someone else along the way.

## What You’ll Find Here
You'll mostly see posts about:
- Cybersecurity basics, tools, and hands-on notes
- Networking tricks and scripting experiments
- Gaming thoughts, tech reviews, and maybe chai-fueled rants or
- Anything about life and random topic

I’m not trying to be an expert. I’m just sharing what I learn as I go — mistakes, wins, and weird discoveries included.

If you’re here reading this, thank you. Stick around. Or don't.
